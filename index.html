                  In 1907, when Retha and Samwell Munder left their small <br/>
                  stationery shop to our grandmother, Pearl, they coudn't <br/>
                  have predicted that she would partner with (and eventually marry) <br/>
                  Aloysius Difflin, a gifted calligrapher and artist. The pair went <br/>
                  on to craft their own unique brand of paper stock, and transformed <br/>
                  a small, black-owned business into a successful corporation.

                  At The MUNDER DIFFLIN Co., we're evolving, too. We're <br/>
                  not afraid to move forward into the future, because we<br/>
                  take the best of the past along with us. For more than 100 years, <br/>
                  we've followed in the traditions set forth by our ancestors. <br/>
                  And we've been defying convention for as long as we've been<br/>
                  in business.

                  We may have traded a brick-and-mortar for an online shop, <br/>
                  but the old traditions remain: earth-friendly, boutique-quality<br/>
                  paper at affordable prices, and extradordinary service with a<br/>
                  (cyber) smile.

                  Today's MUNDER DIFFLIN is innovating once again. After the 2010 <br/>
                  launch of <i>Gurch</i>, our high-eco paper made from 50% post-<br/>
                  consumer waste revolutionized the industry, we are thrilled to <br/>
                  introduce <i>Barsh</i> - a light-weight, eco paper available in <br/>
                  over 60 rainbow-rich colors. This year saw the introduction of <br/>
                  <i>Heber</i>, made from an unprecedented 80% post-consumer waste, <br/>
                  and <i>Maran</i>, our first ever high-eco paper made from entirely<br/>
                  renewable resources, including South African bamboo, or <i>bamboes</i>,<br/>
                  grown by Fair Trade farmers, and hemp, grown in our very own hemp garden.
