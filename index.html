        <div id="about-us">
            <p id="whoare">The world is constantly changing - constantly evolving. If you stay in one place too long, you could
               get left behind. At The Munder Difflin Co., we're evolving, too. We're not afraid to move forward into the future,
               because we take the best of the past along with us. And we've been defying convention for as long as
               we've been in business.
            </p>
            <p>When Retha and Samwell Munder left their small stationery shop to their our grandmother, Pearl, in 1907,
               they coudn't have predicted that she would partner with, and eventually marry, Aloysius Difflin, a gifted
               calligrapher and artist. The pair went on to craft their own unique brand of paper stock, and turned a small,
               black-owned business into a successful corporation.
            </p>
            <p>These days, there are far fewer stationery shops than pharmacies, but Leda and Bill Difflin are far from your standard CEOs.
               For more than 100 years, we've followed in the traditions set forth by our ancestors.
            </p>
            <p>
               Today's Munder Difflin is innovating once again. After a sucessful 2010 launch of our <i>Gurch</i> - our high-eco paper made
               from 50% post-consumer waste revolutionized the industry, we are thrilled to introduce <i>Barsh</i>
               This year we introduc  We may have traded a
               brick-and-mortar for an online shop, but the old traditions remain: quality paper, affordable prices, and extradordinary service
               with a <i>(cyber)</i> smile.
                We take paper into the 21st century, and beyond.
