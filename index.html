            <p id="whoare">The world is constantly changing - constantly evolving. If you stay in one place too long, you could
               get left behind. At The Munder Difflin Co., we're evolving, too. We're not afraid to move forward into the future,
               because we take the best of the past along with us. And we've been defying convention for as long as
               we've been in business.
            </p>
            <p>When Retha and Samwell Munder left their small stationery shop to their our grandmother, Pearl, in 1907,
               they coudn't have predicted that she would partner with, and eventually marry, Aloysius Difflin, a gifted
               calligrapher and artist. The pair went on to craft their own unique brand of paper stock, using recycled paper waste,
               locally-farmed hemp, and later, <i>bamboes</i>, a South African variety of bamboo, making them more than 50 years
               ahead of the surge to use renewable resources.
            </p>
            <p>These days, there are far fewer stationery shops than pharmacies, but Leda and Bill Difflin are far from your standard proprietors.
              For more than 100 years, we've followed in the traditions set forth by our ancestors. We may have traded a brick-and-mortar for an
              online shop, but the old traditions remain: quality paper, affordable prices, and extradordinary service with a <i>(cyber)</i> smile.
              We take paper into the 21st century, and beyond.
            </p>
